# Radium Music - A music remixer

Author: Madhan Kumar R

Hello! I am Madhan, a passionate coder. I have created a music app for remixing songs using Python. Through this project, I gained knowledge about APIs, emailing, and the workings of audio processing. This project has drived me to become not only a better backend developer but also work on my frontend skills . 

This experience helped me explore and understand audio components like pitch, volume, and bassâ€”key elements that shape music. It not only cleared many of my doubts but also deepened my appreciation for how music is constructed and manipulated.

Feel free to dive into my code! Your feedback and user reactions would mean a lot to me and help me grow into an even better developer. ðŸ˜Š
